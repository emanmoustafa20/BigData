# Big Data Exercises and Assignments

## Description

This repository contains a collection of exercises and assignments based on my work for my diploma course in Big Data. Reading and Processing the data was implemented using Hadoop and Spark frameworks and other BigData tools. 
Additionally, the running environment was built using both Docker Images and local setups. These exercises are designed to provide practical experience in handling large datasets, performing complex data processing tasks, and understanding distributed computing fundamentals.
